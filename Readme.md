[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MattesGroeger/TravisExample-iOS.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MattesGroeger/TravisExample-iOS)

This project demonstrates the usage of [Travis CI](http://www.travis-ci.org/) for testing, building, signing and distributing an App. [The gist](https://gist.github.com/johanneswuerbach/5559514) from [Johannes WÃ¼rbach](https://github.com/johanneswuerbach) was a great help for me in setting up this project. A detailed explaination on how to use it [can be found on objc.io](http://www.objc.io/issue-6/travis-ci.html).

### Overview

It combines the following services/tools:
* Dependencies with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)
* Testing with [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi)
* Building with [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool)
* CI with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* Distribution with [Testflight](https://testflightapp.com/)
* Distribution with [Hockeyapp](http://hockeyapp.net/)

### Setup

Open Terminal and follow these steps:
```
git clone git@github.com:MattesGroeger/TravisExample-iOS.git
cd TravisExample-iOS
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
pod install
open TravisExample.xcworkspace
```

Now you can inspect and run the App locally.

### Notes

Please note that the latest version of xctool doesn't support [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) and [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta) tests. You can manually rollback to version 0.1.11 by following these steps:

```
cd /usr/local
brew versions xctool
```

Now pick the git commit hash of version `0.1.11` and proceed:

```
git checkout 4cf7bf9 Library/Formula/xctool.rb
brew uninstall xctool
brew install xctool
```

Travis is still using an older version of xctool which works fine with [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) and [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta).
